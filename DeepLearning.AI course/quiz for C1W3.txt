1 How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
They isolate features in images

2 What does the Pooling technique do to the images?
Reduces information in them while maintaining some features

3 True or  False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter the output will be 26x26
True

4 After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56
False

5 How does using Convolutions in our Deep neural network impact training?
Its impact will depend on other factors.
